# Summary

+ EIC is one of the first experiments to be designed with the support of AI.

+ The current tracking system at EIC is an [AI-assisted design](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.09185)

+ For the “first” time a framework integrating the full detector design using Geant4-based simulation coupled to MOO has been developed. This framework can be massively parallelized.

  + Modular framework : applicable to EIC Detector - 1.

  + Pareto solutions can be explored post hoc and decision making can be done based on cost, engineering realisation etc.

+ The EIC tracker optimisation is a continuous and an iterative process. AI had assisted in making technological choices for the tracker design.
